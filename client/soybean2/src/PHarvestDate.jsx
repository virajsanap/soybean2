            Harvest date predictions were made using SoyStage and assuming 10 days from planting to emergence. We estimated planting date and maturity group combinations would be ready for harvest on average 10 days after hitting R7. Previous research in North Carolina has indicated that SoyStage, developed in the Midsouth USA, predicts reproductive growth stages in North Carolina within 5â€“10 days of accuracy. Three locations were selected across North Carolina to give the user a general idea on harvest dates, but if you want to plug in your specific location in the state and planned production practices, please visit SoyStage.
